# 🌡️Smart Thermostat (SysTec Prototype)
# CS350

This project demonstrates a working smart thermostat prototype built with a Raspberry Pi 4B, AHT20 temperature/humidity sensor, 16x2 LCD, and two LEDs to simulate heating and cooling states.

## Features
- Temperature and humidity sensing (AHT20 via I2C)
- LCD display with live data
- Button-controlled state machine (Off → Heat → Cool)
- LED fading indicators
- UART simulation for cloud data transfer

## Files
- `Thermostat.py` – Main program code
- `StateMachine.pdf` – System state diagram
- `CS350 Final Project.docx` – Project report
